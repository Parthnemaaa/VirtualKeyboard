# VirtualKeyboard
This project is an AI-powered virtual keyboard that allows users to type without physical contact, using hand gesture recognition. Built with OpenCV and Mediapipe, it tracks hand landmarks in real time and maps finger positions to a virtual keyboard layout displayed on the screen.
